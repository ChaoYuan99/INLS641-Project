# INLS641-Project Final Report
# Data Analytics of COVID-19 in New York City After Omicron Entering the U.S.
## Goals
1. Differences before and after Omicron hits New York City
2. Differences of COVID-19 Data in each region of New York City

Our project goal is to study the Omicron variant's existing COVID-19 data in New York City.   Specifically, we want to learn the differences before and after Omicron hits New York City. For example, what has happened in terms of cases, hospitalizations, and deaths in New York City since Omicron entered the U.S.? Also, we want to discover the differences of COVID-19 data in each region to see the similarities and differences between each area of New York City. 

### User Personas:
Our initial idea is that we want to create this data visualization website for scientists and public users since we think that scientists in public health could use our website to help them collect more data and analyze the COVID-19 data more deeply. We also believe that the public may also be the target users since they would know where it is safer or where they should wear their masks and stay alert to the pandemic. It would also be helpful for international students like me. There are so many international students in the United States, especially in New York City. Our website could change their study plans based on our visual analytics of COVID-19 data.

After we finalized our prototype, we think that our users are not for professionals because we want to use the COVID-19 data in New York City to do a simple data visualization. Instead, our intended users are tourists or international students who are not familiar with New York City and have never been to New York City before. Therefore, this website is perfect for them because it has a simple design and user interactions.

### Analytical Questions
1.What has happened in New York City since Omicron entered the U.S.?
2.What are the differences in cases, hospitalizations, and deaths in New York City after Omicron entered the United States?
3.What are the differences of COVID-19 data in New York City in terms of different zip code areas?

## Data
In this project, we want to use reliable and accurate datasets. Therefore, we choose the COVID-19 Health Data in New York City from NYC Open Data, which includes the daily count of New York City residents who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, number of hospitalizations, and number of deaths. Our team downloads the dataset directly from the open data of New York and stores the datasets as a CSV file. These datasets need further cleaning to collect relevant data for our project data visualization.

## Intended Visualization Design
Here are the two sketches we made for our website design. As you can see from our illustration, we initially want to have two pages for our website. The first page contains information, including confirmed cases and death cases after the Omicron hits New York City. It also has a New York City map with five regions on the map. We want to make it clickable so that if the users want to interact with the map to see the details of each area, they can click on that region, and there will be more detailed graphs on the second page.

For the second page, we want to have a line chart that includes all the information about COVID-19 data. For example, it should have the number of total cases, number of hospitalizations, and number of deaths. All three data will be on the same chart to show the comparison and relationship among these three attributes. On the left side, there will be a select box with the option to select different months to compare COVID-19 data with other months.
